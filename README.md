The ESP8266-based boards, Arduino-sized, are very popular as they efectively give you Arduino Uno capabilities but with built in wi-fi. Wemos have a D1 (R2) version that is very popular.

Now, Wemos have a mini-sized board, the Wemos D1 Mini which has the same functionality as the full-sized board and which lends itself to allowing stackable shields, or add-ons, to give it extra functionality.

For example, you want to add a tiny OLED screen?  

How about a LiPO battery module to keep it running?  

Or a temperature module?  

Yes, all these are available and demoed in this video, with further items available online.

This is a detailed introduction and in the 40 minutes we cover the essentials with some basic demo code to get your project off the ground.
